# Sanity Tracker
Inspired by [a request](https://svn.fantasygrounds.com/forums/showthread.php?59500-PFRPG-Live-Hitpoints-from-Constitution-Extension&p=525035&viewfull=1#post525035), here is an extension I have made to help track character sanity using the rules from [Paizo's Horror Adventures rulebook](https://paizo.com/products/btpy9n5a/discuss&page=10?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Horror-Adventures).

# Compatibility and Instructions
This extension has been tested with [FantasyGrounds Unity](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/home/FantasyGroundsUnity.php) v4.4.9 (2023-12-18).

In the upper right of the character sheet (under the chat bubble) there will be a brain button. This will bring up that character's sanity tracker.

# Features
* Calculate sanity score, edge, and threshold
* Track sanity damage (turns red if it's equal to or higher than sanity edge)
* Track madnesses incurred
* Roll saving throws and announce success/failure
