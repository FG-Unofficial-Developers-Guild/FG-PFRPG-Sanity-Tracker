# PFRPG Sanity Tracker
Inspired by a request, here is an extension I have made to help track character sanity using the rules from Horror Adventures.

# Compatibility and Instructions
This extension has been fully tested with FantasyGrounds Classic 3.3.10 and FantasyGrounds Unity 4.0.0 (2020-07-07)
In the upper right of the character sheet (under the chat bubble) there will be a brain button. This will bring up that character's sanity tracker.

# Features
* Calculate sanity score, edge, and threshold
* Track madnesses incurred
* Track sanity damage (turns red if it's equal to or higher than sanity edge)
